### MPhys project public summary
#### Geographical profiling of crime

This is a public summary for my MPhys project on 'Geographical profiling of crime' I did under supervision of [Prof. Paul Palmer](http://www.palmergroup.org/paul-palmer) in 2015 - 2016. This public summary is targeted at general audience and presents step-by-step data exploration of the pre-processed Chicago crime data.

##### Setup
I suggest using Python `virtualenv`. To install all the necessary dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use `jupyter notebook` to run the Jupyter Notebook `Adam_Golinski_Public_summary.ipynb`.

##### Pre-processed data
This project is using data I have preprocessed by cleaning and formatting appropriate columns. You can download it from the links below. I am hosting the files on Dropbox and I will try to maintain it. Place them in the folder of the project.

##### Original data
Crime data was obtained in the form of a CSV file from the [City of Chicago data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).  
Weather data can be obtained from the [NOAA website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets).
